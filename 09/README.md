# Examination 9 - Use Ansible Vault for sensitive information

In the previous examination we set a password for the `webappuser`. To keep this password
in plain text in a playbook, or otherwise, is a huge security hole, especially
if we publish it to a public place like GitHub.

There is a way to keep sensitive information encrypted and unlocked at runtime with the
`ansible-vault` tool that comes with Ansible.

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/vault_guide/index.html

*IMPORTANT*: Keep a copy of the password for _unlocking_ the vault in plain text, so that
I can run the playbook without having to ask you for the password.

# QUESTION A

Make a copy of the playbook from the previous examination, call it `09-mariadb-password.yml`
and modify it so that the task that sets the password is injected via an Ansible variable,
instead of as a plain text string in the playbook.



It'll be injected by using some form om variable that contains the password. In my case I had the variable holding my true password which it refered to. I tried refering it to another file, and also within the same file. 



# QUESTION B

When the [QUESTION A](#question-a) is solved, use `ansible-vault` to store the password in encrypted
form, and make it possible to run the playbook as before, but with the password as an
Ansible Vault secret instead.

So this is pretty much the same, except that we can either start by making a vault file by doing ansible-vault create or we can encrypt an existing file with ansible vautl encrypt

Vault password: 123
